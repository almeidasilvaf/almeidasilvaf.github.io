## Background

For my undergrad studies, I attended the State University of Northern 
Rio de Janeiro (UENF) to study Biological Sciences, 
graduating with distinction (*magna cum laude*) in 2019. Like many great 
universities in Brazil, UENF stands out due to its strong Scientific Initiation
program that allows undergrad students to start a research project at an early
stage of their careers. Thanks to this program, I joined the lab of 
[Dr. Thiago Venancio](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BAIFUiAAAAAJ&hl=en)
as an undergrad trainee. Thiago has been a truly exceptional mentor, and he 
supervised me in a project that aimed at exploring transcriptional regulation
in soybean (*Glycine max*) using gene coexpression networks inferred from
a large compendium of RNA-seq set with >1000 samples (which later
became the [Soybean Expression Atlas](https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.14850)).

In 2020, I joined a Master's program in Plant Biotechnology at UENF, still
under the supervision of [Dr. Thiago Venancio](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BAIFUiAAAAAJ&hl=en),
where I developed a statistical framework to integrate data from genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) and RNA-seq experiments, particularly using 
network-based approaches. These methods are now available in the R 
packages `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("BioNERO")` and `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("cageminer")`,
both available on Bioconductor. We then used these methods to identify and 
prioritize candidate genes involved in resistance to biotic stresses caused
by multiple pathogens and pests. At the same time, I was also leading
the implementation of a 
[much larger and better version of the Soybean Expression Atlas](https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.16459), 
now with >5000 samples. After ~5 years under the mentorship of 
[Dr. Thiago Venancio](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BAIFUiAAAAAJ&hl=en),
I was already a well-rounded and experienced bioinformatician at the end of my
Master's.

In February 2022, I moved to Belgium to start my PhD in Bioinformatics at 
Ghent University under the supervision of
[Dr. Yves Van de Peer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tBs2BVMAAAAJ&hl=en),
at the VIB Center for Plant Systems Biology.
Since then, I've been studying the impact of gene and genome duplications
on plant gene regulatory networks. For that, I use a combination of different
approaches, including evolutionary genomics, high-dimensional (mostly 
transcriptomic) data analyses, and network science. Besides, I often find myself
in a position where I cannot find software tools to do what I want, so I end
up developing such tools myself. I am the developer and maintainer 
of >10 R packages, most of them available on [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/), 
as well as web applications.
