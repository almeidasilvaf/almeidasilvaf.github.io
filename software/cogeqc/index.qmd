## Summary

The goal of cogeqc is to facilitate systematic quality checks on standard comparative genomics analyses to help researchers detect issues and select the most suitable parameters for each data set. Currently, cogeqc can be used to assess:

1.  **Genome assembly quality:** users can assess genome completeness using Best Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCOs). cogeqc allows users to run BUSCO from the comfort of an R session and explore summary statistics with publication-ready plots.

2.  **Orthogroup inference:** orthogroups are assessed based on the percentage of shared protein domains in all ortogroups. The rationale for this approach is that genes in the same orthogroup evolved from a common ancestor, so the percentage of conserved protein domains in an orthogroup should be as high as possible.

3.  **Synteny detection:** synteny detection is assessed using network-based approaches, namely the clustering coefficient and degree of a synteny network.
