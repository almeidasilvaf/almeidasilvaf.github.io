## Summary

The goal of HybridExpress is to perform comparative transcriptomic analyses of 
hybrids relative to their progenitor species (a.k.a. experimental trios). 
The package features:

1. **Calculation of midparent expression values**, which are in silico 
samples obtained from the mean, sum, or weighted mean of random sample pairs 
from each parent;

2. **Exploratory analyses of sample grouping** with PCA plots and heatmaps of
hierarchically-clustered pairwise sample correlations;

3. **Identification of differentially expressed genes** between hybrids and 
their progenitor species, hybrids and midparent values, and the two parents. 
If spike-in standards are available, HybridExpress uses them to normalize the 
count data by transcriptome size;

4. **Classification of genes in expression-based categories and classes** based 
on Rapp et al. (2009). The 12 expression categories proposed by 
Rapp et al. (2009) are grouped into 5 major classes (transgressive 
up-regulation, transgressive down-regulation, additivity, expression-level 
dominance toward parent 1, and expression-level dominance toward parent 2);

5. **Functional analyses** through the identification of overrepresented 
functional terms for gene sets of interest.
