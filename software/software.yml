  image: hexlogos/featured_doubletrouble_hex.png
  path: https://bioconductor.org/packages/doubletrouble/
  description: >
    An R package to to identify duplicated genes from whole-genome protein 
    sequences and classify them based on their modes of duplication. 
    The duplication modes are i. segmental duplication (SD); ii. 
    tandem duplication (TD); iii. proximal duplication (PD); 
    iv. transposed duplication (TRD) and; v. dispersed duplication (DD). 
    Transposon-derived duplicates (TRD) can be further subdivided into 
    rTRD (retrotransposon-derived duplication) and dTRD 
    (DNA transposon-derived duplication). Users can also calculate 
    substitution rates per substitution site (i.e., Ka and Ks) from 
    duplicate pairs, find peaks in Ks distributions with Gaussian Mixture 
    Models (GMMs), and classify gene pairs into age groups based on Ks peaks.

  path: https://bioconductor.org/packages/HybridExpress/
  description: >
    An R package to perform comparative transcriptomics analysis of hybrids 
    (or allopolyploids) relative to their progenitor species. The package 
    features functions to perform exploratory analyses of sample grouping, 
    identify differentially expressed genes in hybrids relative to their 
    progenitors, classify genes in expression categories (N = 12) and 
    classes (N = 5), and perform functional analyses. 
    We also provide users with graphical functions for the seamless 
    creation of publication-ready figures that are commonly used 
    in the literature.

  description: >
    An R package to facilitate systematic quality checks on standard 
    comparative genomics analyses, and to help researchers detect issues and 
    select the most suitable parameters for each data set. 
    cogeqc can be used to asses: i. genome assembly and annotation quality 
    with BUSCOs and comparisons of statistics with publicly available 
    genomes on the NCBI; ii. orthogroup inference using a protein domain-based 
    approach and; iii. synteny detection using synteny network properties. 
    cogeqc also offers visualization functions to explore QC summary statistics.

- package: bears
  type: software
  chrono-order: 8
  image: hexlogos/featured_bears_hex.png
  path: https://github.com/almeidasilvaf/bears
  description: >
    An R package with an RNA-seq pipeline to create gene expression atlases 
    from publicly available bulk RNA-seq data in NCBI's SRA. Users can download 
    raw reads, preprocess them, map to a reference genome and transcriptome, 
    and quantify the expression at the gene and transcript levels. 
    The goal of bears is to make RNA-seq data analysis pipelines reproducible, 
    with a framework built on state-of-the art methods and software tools, and 
    all of that in the comfort of an R session.
    
- package: planttfhunter
  type: software
  chrono-order: 7
  image: hexlogos/featured_planttfhunter_hex.png
  path: https://bioconductor.org/packages/planttfhunter/
  description: >
    An R package to identify plant transcription factors (TFs) from 
    protein sequence data and classify them into families and subfamilies 
    using the classification scheme implemented in PlantTFDB. 
    TFs are identified using pre-built hidden Markov model profiles for 
    DNA-binding domains. Then, auxiliary and forbidden domains are used 
    with DNA-binding domains to classify TFs into families and 
    subfamilies (when applicable). Currently, TFs can be classified in 
    58 different TF families/subfamilies.
  
- package: magrene

  chrono-order: 6

  path: https://bioconductor.org/packages/magrene/
  description: >
    An R package for the identification and analysis of graph motifs in 
    (duplicated) gene regulatory networks (GRNs), including lambda, V, PPI V, 
    delta, and bifan motifs. GRNs can be tested for motif enrichment by 
    comparing motif frequencies to a null distribution generated from 
    degree-preserving simulated GRNs. Motif frequencies can be analyzed in 
    the context of gene duplications to explore the impact of small-scale 
    and whole-genome duplications on gene regulatory networks. Finally, 
    users can calculate interaction similarity for gene pairs based on 
    the Sorensen-Dice similarity index.

  path: https://bioconductor.org/packages/syntenet/
  description: >
    An R package to infer synteny networks from whole-genome protein sequences 
    and analyze them. Anchor pairs are detected with the MCScanX algorithm, 
    which was ported to this package with the Rcpp framework for R and C++ 
    integration. Anchor pairs from synteny analyses are treated as an 
    undirected unweighted graph (i.e., a synteny network), and users can 
    perform: i. network clustering; ii. phylogenomic profiling (by identifying 
    which species contain which clusters) and; iii. microsynteny-based 
    phylogeny reconstruction with maximum likelihood.
