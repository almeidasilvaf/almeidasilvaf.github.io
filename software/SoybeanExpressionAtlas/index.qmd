## Summary

Soybean is a crucial crop worldwide, used as a source of food, feed, 
and industrial products due to its high protein and oil content. Previously, 
the rapid accumulation of soybean RNA-seq data in public databases and the 
computational challenges of processing raw RNA-seq data motivated us to 
develop the Soybean Expression Atlas, a gene expression database of over a 
thousand RNA-seq samples. Over the past few years, our database has allowed 
researchers to explore the expression profiles of important gene families, 
discover genes associated with agronomic traits, and understand the 
transcriptional dynamics of cellular processes. Here, we present the Soybean 
Expression Atlas v2, an updated version of our database with a fourfold 
increase in the number of samples, featuring transcript- and gene-level 
transcript abundance matrices for 5481 publicly available RNA-seq samples. 
New features in our database include the availability of transcript-level 
abundance estimates and equivalence classes to explore differential transcript 
usage, abundance estimates in bias-corrected counts to increase the accuracy 
of differential gene expression analyses, a new web interface with improved 
data visualization and user experience, and a reproducible and scalable 
pipeline available as an R package. The Soybean Expression Atlas v2 is 
available at https://soyatlas.venanciogroup.uenf.br/, and it will accelerate 
soybean research, empowering researchers with high-quality and easily 
accessible gene expression data.
