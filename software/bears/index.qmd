## Summary

In the past decades, there has been an exponential accumulation of RNA-seq data 
in public repositories. This steep increase paved the way to the creation of 
gene expression atlases, which consist in comprehensive collections of 
expression data from public databases, analyzed with a single pipeline for 
consistency and cross-project comparison. bears is a package that allows you 
to create your own gene expression atlas for a given species using public 
data. The package features:

- Data download from NCBI’s Sequence Read Archive (SRA) or the European 
Nucleotide Archive (ENA).
- Sequence quality check and trimming of low-quality sequences and adapters.
- Removal of rRNA, which are typical problems of libraries that were prepared 
with the rRNA depletion protocol.
- Read mapping against a reference genome.
- Transcriptome assembly.
- Quantification of gene- and transcript-level transcript abundance 
with alignment-based and alignment-free methods.
