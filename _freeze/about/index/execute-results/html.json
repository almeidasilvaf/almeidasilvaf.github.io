Like many great \nuniversities in Brazil, UENF stands out due to its strong Scientific Initiation\nprogram that allows undergrad students to start a research project at an early\nstage of their careers. Thanks to this program, I joined the lab of \n[Dr. Thiago Venancio](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BAIFUiAAAAAJ&hl=en)\nas an undergrad trainee. Thiago has been a truly exceptional mentor, and he \nsupervised me in a project that aimed at exploring transcriptional regulation\nin soybean (*Glycine max*) using gene coexpression networks inferred from\na large compendium of RNA-seq set with >1000 samples (which later\nbecame the [Soybean Expression Atlas](https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.14850)).\n\n::: {.column-page}\n\n![Sunset at the whistle-shaped Convention Center at the State University of Northern Rio de Janeiro (UENF).

These methods are now available in the R \npackages *[BioNERO](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.19/BioNERO)* and *[cageminer](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.19/cageminer)*,\nboth available on Bioconductor. We then used these methods to identify and \nprioritize candidate genes involved in resistance to biotic stresses caused\nby multiple pathogens and pests. At the same time, I was also leading\nthe implementation of a \n[much larger and better version of the Soybean Expression Atlas](https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.16459), \nnow with >5000 samples. After ~5 years under the mentorship of \n[Dr. Thiago Venancio](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BAIFUiAAAAAJ&hl=en),\nI was already a well-rounded and experienced bioinformatician at the end of my\nMaster's.\n\n---\n\nIn February 2022, I moved to Belgium to start my PhD in Bioinformatics at \nGhent University under the supervision of\n[Dr. Yves Van de Peer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tBs2BVMAAAAJ&hl=en),\nat the VIB Center for Plant Systems Biology.\nSince then, I've been studying the impact of gene and genome duplications\non plant gene regulatory networks. For that, I use a combination of different\napproaches, including evolutionary genomics, high-dimensional (mostly \ntranscriptomic) data analyses, and network science. Besides, I often find myself\nin a position where I cannot find software tools to do what I want, so I end\nup developing such tools myself. I am the developer and maintainer \nof >10 R packages, most of them available on [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/), \nas well as web applications.\n\n::: {.column-page}\n![Aerial footage of the Technology Park in Ghent.
